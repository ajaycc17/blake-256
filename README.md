# BLAKE-256 (or BLAKE32) Hash function: BS and MS Project- IISERB(2022-23)

Under the BS project, the working principles and methods the BLAKE-256 hash functions was studied and implemented to produce hash for a given string or any binary file. Later, under the MS project, properties of BLAKE-256 were analysed and preimage attacks were mounted on the round-reduced(i.e. 1.5 and 2 rounds) versions. This repository contains both the works combined and uses C/C++ programming language for implementations of the functions and attacks.
